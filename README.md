# Page View Time Series Visualizer

This project is part of the **freeCodeCamp Data Analysis with Python** certification. It focuses on visualizing daily page views of the freeCodeCamp forum using **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn**, and **Pandas**.

---

## Project Objective

- Clean the dataset by removing outliers.
- Create three types of visualizations:
  1. **Line plot** – visualizes the time series trend.
  2. **Bar plot** – shows average monthly page views for each year.
  3. **Box plots** – explores year-wise and month-wise distributions (trend & seasonality).

## Dataset

- **File:** `fcc-forum-pageviews.csv`
- **Source:** [freeCodeCamp GitHub](https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/boilerplate-page-view-time-series-visualizer)
- **Columns:**
